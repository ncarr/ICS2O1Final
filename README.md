# ICS2O1 Final Project

## Proposal
We are making a car chase game where you avoid other cars, buildings, hydrants and occasional construction sites. The user will be able to accelerate and decelerate the car and have it change lanes. The car will stay in the same space at the bottom of the screen, but the background will move to make it look like the car is moving. There will be a main menu where the user can interact with the mouse or keyboard and it will have an option to learn to interact with the game. The user will interact in the game with the arrow keys. We will be using sprites in Pygame for graphics and the cars and obstacles will be randomly generated.
